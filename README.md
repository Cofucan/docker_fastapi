# Simple Task Creator

This is a very simple FastAPI app that allows creation of tasks with task title and descrption. It automatically gives each task a unique ID and logs the dates for creation and updating.

It uses a Postgres database and Tortoise ORM as the object relational mapper. It is also dockerized.
